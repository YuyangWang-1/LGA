## 1. Team Vision and Mission
Our vision is to enhance LaGuardia’s operational resilience through real-time, data-driven insights.  

Our mission is to build a predictive web tool that forecasts delays and supports proactive decision-making.  

Together, we aim to improve passenger experience while advancing our skills in data science and stakeholder collaboration.  

---

## 2. Project Objectives and Scope
- Build a real-time predictive engine that integrates flight, weather, and FAA alert data to forecast delays at LaGuardia Airport.  
- Design a responsive web application for the Airport Operations Center that provides alerts, visualizations, and actionable recommendations.  
- Scope includes data integration, predictive modeling, geospatial analysis, and scenario simulation within two semesters.
